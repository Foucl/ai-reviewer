Shared Dependencies:

1. **Python Standard Libraries**: These are shared across all the files. Libraries such as os, sys, and subprocess will be used for handling local repos and branches.

2. **Langchain**: This is a Python library that will be used across all the files for analyzing and handling large code bases.

3. **GitPython**: This is a Python library used for interacting with Git repositories. It will be used in "repo_handler.py", "branch_analyzer.py", and their respective test files.

4. **DiffLib**: This is a Python library for comparing sequences, including lines of text. It will be used in "code_diff.py" and its test file.

5. **RepoHandler Class**: This class will be defined in "repo_handler.py" and used in "main.py", "branch_analyzer.py", "code_diff.py", and their respective test files.

6. **BranchAnalyzer Class**: This class will be defined in "branch_analyzer.py" and used in "main.py", "code_diff.py", and their respective test files.

7. **CodeDiff Class**: This class will be defined in "code_diff.py" and used in "main.py" and its test file.

8. **CleanCodePrinciples Class**: This class will be defined in "clean_code_principles.py" and used in "main.py" and its test file.

9. **SoftwareCraftsmanship Class**: This class will be defined in "software_craftsmanship.py" and used in "main.py" and its test file.

10. **Utils Functions**: These are helper functions defined in "utils.py" and used across all the files and their respective test files.

11. **Test Cases**: These are defined in each of the test files and are used to test the functionality of the classes and functions defined in the respective files.

12. **pytest**: This is a Python testing framework used in all the test files.
